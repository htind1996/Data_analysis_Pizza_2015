Data analysis of 2015 pizza sales using SQL and Excel to create an interactive dashboard.


Project Overview

The Pizza Sales Dashboard (2015) project focuses on analyzing a yearâ€™s worth of pizza sales data to uncover meaningful insights about business performance, customer preferences, and product trends. This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Microsoft Excel for data visualization and dashboard creation. The goal is to combine data analysis and storytelling to deliver actionable insights that can help improve business decisions, menu strategy, and overall profitability.

ðŸ§  Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were to:

Identify the top-performing pizzas based on sales revenue and order quantity.

Track sales performance over time, including daily, monthly, and seasonal trends.

Analyze pizza size and category preferences to understand customer buying behavior.

Highlight insights that could guide marketing campaigns, inventory planning, and staff allocation.

Through these analyses, the project aims to demonstrate how structured data can be transformed into interactive insights through SQL queries and Excel dashboards.

ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies

SQL: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and summarization from the sales dataset.

Microsoft Excel: Used to visualize data with pivot tables, charts, and an interactive dashboard.

This combination allowed efficient data manipulation with SQL and intuitive visual storytelling in Excel.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

The analysis revealed several interesting findings:

Classic Deluxe and BBQ Chicken Pizzas were among the top-selling items by revenue.

Sales were highest during weekends and evening hours, indicating strong leisure-time demand.

Medium-sized pizzas accounted for the majority of orders, balancing price and portion preferences.

Seasonal trends showed peaks during holiday months, reflecting festive consumption patterns.

ðŸš€ Outcome

The final Excel dashboard provides an interactive and visually appealing overview of sales performance. It allows users to filter data by pizza category, size, and time period to explore trends independently. This project highlights how SQL and Excel together can be used for practical business intelligence and data-driven decision-making.
